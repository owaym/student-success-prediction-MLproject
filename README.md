# student-success-prediction-MLproject
Education is an important part of our lives and
even during pandemic we continued getting the education through online or offline resources.   Moreover, the recent advances has been influential in
education field and it has become essential for the
institutions to adapt to these changes. The aim of
this paper is to present the results of a project done
by the researchers given about. We have used an
public dataset which has been used in different articles. The aim of the project was to answer the
questions if it is possible to predict the students’
success based on the features collected through
Open University (OU) and if the demographics of
the students can be used to predict their achievement. The dataset consists of 7 different courses
which are presented to the students via online platforms. We used this dataset and tried to predict
students’ success. The model was trained by using
Python 3.0. We have implemented different types
of algorithms to see how the performance changes.
The algorithms used were Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, FeedForward Neural Network, K
Nearest Neighbour, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
and Naïve Bayes. Random forest was the best performing algorithm while the performance of Naïve
Bayes was poor. The dataset had many missing
values and as we also know the student’s success is
dependent on many different factors. We hope that
further research on student success prediction will
contribute to the improvement or development of
educational technology systems.
